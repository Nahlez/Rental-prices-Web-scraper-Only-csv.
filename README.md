## Rental prices - Web scraper. (Only csv reports)

Due to how difficult it is to find an apartment in one of the big cities of Denmark; I have made a script to scrape one of the most famous housing websites in Denmark because their search engine does not filter by "Move-in-Price" (It is the first full payment you have to make when you move into a new rental home).

*Currently my script is private. I have made it using (python) Selenium and Xpath to extract the HTML elements.*

As an output that generates csv files with different data about apartments / houses.

The apartments were filtered for approximately a maximum of 9500/10000 kr per month.

You can find the following columns in the csv:

Type |Rent | Move-in price| Address| Link.
